# MusicTranspose2

… is a mobile app for musicians. Its a Platform to digitize sheet music.

The idea behind this project is to modernize the classical music environment, with big archieves and old dusty music scores. With our mobile app you can simply photograph and manage your sheet music.

## USE - CASE

A voluntary association (marching band) has bought music scores over the last 20 years. This scores where all printed. Organizing this sheet isn't always that simple, someone forgot his music sheets, someone never got any and so on…  
To avoid this problem, a digitized version of existing music scores schould be available for the whole association on demand.

Main Problem:
Big amount of printet music scores
